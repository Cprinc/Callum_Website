Welcome to My own Website. like in most of my projects I am completly new to most of this including HTML and CSS. 
The website will be where I show projects and just get used to using HTML and CSS and other applications

To Do list:  
  - Get buttons to work to open new pages
  - Understand formatting
    - Dynamic Formatting (Make page do cool things. Focus on other things first)
  - publish
  - add images
